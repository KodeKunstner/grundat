\section{General}
Wrong spelling of "======= Loading Progam =======".

Cursor can go to the left of '>>>' in interpreter, meaning that for example the home-key cannot be used for start writing at the beginning of the line.

No integration with docstrings.

\section{Turtle}
Does not support fractional degrees, limits it significantly (most of DiSessa/Abelson would not work).

No default world object, making it unsuitable for introduction.
